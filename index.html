            <p>It should be no surprise that goals motivate us and inspire us. The most powerful goals are self-directed
                goals.
                Self-directed internal goals. They include understanding your priorities and purpose in life, knowing
                what you believe
                to be most important and using those goals as a daily guide for how you will choose to live your life.

            <p>"Not every dream will come true, and not every dream is from God. But when your dreams connect with God's
                plans, you'll
                find open doors that you never thought you'd see.I already learned the basic HTML and CSS. I can build
                any simple
                website. I can even teach my grandma how to make simple website. My goal is to build 3 websites and
                learn advanced
                topics."

                <p>Civil engineering is a professional engineering discipline that deals with the design, construction,
                    and maintenance of
                    the physical and naturally built environment, including public works such as roads, bridges, canals,
                    dams, airports,
                    sewage systems, pipelines, structural components of buildings, and railways</p>

                <p>A construction engineer can be defined as a civil engineer who is tasked with the oversight and
                    management of a
                    large-scale, complex construction project. Typically, these projects involve both buildings and the
                    infrastructure that
                    supports them. Construction engineers may collaborate with other engineers, and also manage building
                    crews, to ensure
                    the project is successful.</p>
